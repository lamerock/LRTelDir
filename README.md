# LRTelDir
Simple Telephone Directory using C# and MS Access

## Author's note:

I used this for reference when I am developing a system. I started working on this using Visual Basic 6 (VB6) when I was still a student. I upgraded it to Visual Basic .Net since VB6 was already obsolete. Then, I converted it to Visual C#. 

You can download the source code here:
[Latest Release](https://github.com/lamerock/LRTelDir/releases/latest)

You need Visual Studio IDE to open the source files.
To open, just run the Visual Studio IDE then go to
**File >> Open Project**.
on the Dialog box, find and choose,
**LRTelDir.sln**

## Troubleshoot

If Visual Studio cannot detect the database during debugging or running of the program, you might need to download the Microsoft Access Database Engine. You may download it on official Microsoft website: [Microsoft Access Database Engine](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255)
